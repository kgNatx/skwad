# Changelog

All notable changes to Skwad are documented in this file.

> **Note:** User-facing release notes are maintained separately in `static/changelog.html`. Keep both in sync — developer details here, plain-language descriptions there.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Session code O/0 confusion.** Typing "O" in the join code input was silently stripped (hex only allows 0-9, A-F). Now auto-corrects O→0 and I→1 instead of eating the character.
- **Join vs create ambiguity.** Joining a session by code showed the same callsign screen as creating a new session with no indication you were joining. Now shows "JOINING SESSION XXXXXX" above the callsign prompt.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Preference picker not showing in join wizard.** Clicking "I HAVE A PREFERENCE" showed the hint text but not the channel grid or spectrum — `classList.add('hidden')` (`display: none !important`) was being "shown" with `style.display = ''`, which can't override `!important`. Switched to consistent `classList.remove('hidden')`.
- **Join without selecting a preference.** JOIN button was always enabled on the channel preference step, allowing pilots to submit with `preferredFreqMHz: 0` (auto-assign) after explicitly choosing "I HAVE A PREFERENCE". JOIN is now disabled until a channel is selected.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Video system change no longer kicks you out.** Changing your video system now updates in place instead of deleting and re-adding the pilot. Cancel returns you to the session with your previous settings intact.
- **Add-pilot FCC buttons.** Leader's add-pilot dialog now uses explicit YES/NO buttons for FCC unlock instead of a single toggle, matching the join wizard.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Channel preferences replace locks.** Pilots set a preferred channel (or auto-assign). Preferences are soft signals -- the optimizer honors them when possible but can override for session quality.
- **Simplified escalation.** Two levels instead of four: Level 0 (clean placement) and Level 1 (pilot chooses buddy-up or partial rebalance).
- **All pilots are rebalanceable.** No permanent locks. Leader's Rebalance All can move anyone, respecting preferences as weights.
- **Rebalance uses two-phase approach.** Surgical pass first (only move conflicted pilots), full re-optimize fallback.

### Added
- **Preference override dialog.** When a preference can't be honored, pilot sees why and where they landed (GOT IT button).
- **Buddy/rebalance choice dialog.** When no clean channel is available, pilot picks: buddy up with someone, or partial rebalance (move the most flexible pilot).
- **AUTO-ASSIGN NEW button.** Self-service channel change option that picks a different channel.
- **Moved-by-rebalance notification.** When a partial rebalance moves you, you see a "You've been moved" dialog with GOT IT button on your next poll.
- **Rebalance recommended indicator.** Subtle nudge on leader's screen when conflicts exist.
- **Force placement for leaders.** Leader can place a pilot on a conflicting channel (buddy-up or overlap accepted).
- **Rebalance preview spectrums.** REBALANCE ALL confirmation now shows before/after spectrum visualizations so the leader can see what will change.
- `POST /api/sessions/{code}/preview-rebalance` — dry-run optimizer endpoint, returns proposed assignments without committing.
- `preferred_frequency_mhz` column in pilots table.
- `rebalance_recommended` flag in GET session response.
- `force` flag on channel change request (leader-only).

### Fixed
- **Leader force-move simplified.** `submitChannelChangeForPilot` always sends `force: true` and commits directly — no more preview/override/choice dialogs that were meant for the pilot, not the leader.
- **Leader force-move to free channel.** Without `force: true`, the optimizer was treating leader's explicit choice as a soft preference and overriding it.
- **Buddy confirmation z-index.** Channel-change sheet now hides before showing buddy confirmation, preventing it from covering the dialog.
- **Cancel from buddy confirmation.** Returns to channel picker instead of dead end.
- **DJI O4 wizard step ordering.** Goggles step now appears before bandwidth step in HTML, matching the actual O4 flow (FCC → Goggles → Bandwidth → Race Mode).
- **Callsign change cancel button.** Fixed duplicate `btn-callsign-cancel` ID — rename to `btn-callsign-change-cancel`.

### Changed
- **Action sheets tightened.** Padding 36px→20px, gap 18px→12px, title 26px→22px for more usable space.
- **Full-screen channel picker.** Channel change sheet uses 100dvh with no border radius.
- **Adaptive channel grid.** `adaptPickerGrid()` sets grid columns dynamically (≤3 channels = N cols, 4+ = 4 cols).
- Non-leader channel picker filters out conflicting channels instead of showing them grayed.
- `white-space: nowrap` on system badges, channel names, and leader buttons to prevent wrapping.
- Leader button padding and letter-spacing reduced to prevent overflow on narrow screens.
- **Session expiry reduced from 24 hours to 12 hours.** `CreateSession()` now uses `12 * time.Hour`.
- **Shrink-to-fit callsigns.** `fitText()` scales long callsigns down (28px→14px min) instead of wrapping.
- **Landing page leader hint.** Explains session leader role and transfer-leadership reminder under START SESSION.
- **Spectrum canvases 10% shorter.** Main 120→108px, action sheets 90→80px. Renderer reads height from CSS.

### Removed
- `channel_locked` and `locked_frequency_mhz` no longer used (columns kept for SQLite compatibility).
- Level 2 (pair unlocking) and Level 3 (buddy-only) escalation -- replaced by Level 1 choice dialog.
- Preview/override/choice dialog flow from leader force-move path (was `submitChannelChangeForPilot`, ~35 lines → 5 lines).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Expanded analog bands** — analog pilots can now select from 4 VTX bands:
  - R (Race Band) — 8 channels, 5658–5917 MHz (existing, still the default)
  - F (Fatshark) — 8 channels, 5740–5880 MHz
  - E (Boscam E) — 8 channels, 5645–5945 MHz
  - L (Low Race) — 8 channels, 5362–5621 MHz
- `FatsharkBand`, `BoscamEBand`, `LowRaceBand` channel tables in `freq/tables.go`
- `AnalogBandMap` lookup and `MergeAnalogBands()` — unions selected bands with frequency deduplication
- `ChannelPool()` gains `analogBands []string` parameter; `PilotInput.AnalogBands` field
- `analog_bands TEXT DEFAULT 'R'` column on pilots table with idempotent migration
- `joinBands()`/`splitBands()` helpers in API handlers for string↔slice conversion
- Band selector UI in join wizard follow-up step (4 toggle buttons, R pre-selected)
- "NOT SURE? JUST USE RACE BAND" helper text for uncertain users
- Band selector in leader's add-pilot dialog
- Frontend `mergeAnalogBands()`, `ANALOG_BAND_MAP`, fatshark/boscam_e/lowrace in `CHANNELS`
- Dynamic spectrum visualization range — expands when pilots use Low Race or upper Boscam E

### Changed
- Analog separated from HDZero in `ChannelPool()` switch (was shared case)
- `analog` removed from `SIMPLE_SYSTEMS` and join wizard no-followup skip list
- Service worker cache bumped to `skwad-v6`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Stability-first optimizer** with graduated escalation (`FindMinimalDisplacement`):
  - Level 0: Lock all existing pilots, slot new pilot into best available channel
  - Level 1: Unlock one flexible pilot at a time, pick solution with best worst-case margin
  - Level 2: Unlock pairs of flexible pilots
  - Level 3: Buddy suggestion — find most compatible pilot to share a frequency with
- `OptimizeWithLocks(pilots, lockedIDs)` — wraps `Optimize()` with forced channel locks
- **Session leader** role (`leader_pilot_id` column on sessions table):
  - First pilot to join becomes leader
  - `POST /api/sessions/{code}/rebalance` — leader-only full reoptimize, returns moved pilots
  - `POST /api/sessions/{code}/transfer-leader` — hand off leadership
  - `POST /api/sessions/{code}/add-pilot` — leader adds phantom pilot with video system options
  - `DELETE /api/pilots/{id}` — leader-only for removing others; self-removal always allowed
- Authorization via `X-Pilot-ID` request header, checked against `leader_pilot_id`
- Leader UI: badge, rebalance-all with confirmation + result dialog, add-pilot with follow-up options (FCC/bandwidth for DJI/Walksnail), change-channel for other pilots, transfer leadership, slide-to-remove (leader only), leader-leave handoff prompt
- Buddy suggestion dialog for Level 3 (join and channel change flows)
- `hasDangerInvolving()` — checks danger conflicts only for moved pilots, ignores pre-existing conflicts
- `flexiblePilots()`, `worstMargin()`, `copyAssignments()` optimizer helpers
- Idempotent schema migration via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with duplicate-column error handling
- `static/changelog.html` — self-hosted user-facing release notes page
- "What's New" link in landing page footer

### Changed
- `HandleJoinSession` uses `FindMinimalDisplacement` instead of `reoptimize()`
- `HandlePreviewJoin` returns `{level, assignment, displaced, buddy_suggestion}` (was `{displaced, has_danger}`)
- `HandleUpdatePilotChannel` uses graduated escalation, removed `?rebalance` query parameter
- `HandlePreviewChannelChange` rewritten with graduated escalation and new response shape
- `HandleUpdatePilotVideoSystem` uses graduated escalation instead of `reoptimize()`
- `HandleDeactivatePilot` no longer calls `reoptimize()` — remaining pilots keep their channels
- `HandleRebalanceAll` returns JSON `{moved: [...]}` instead of 204 No Content
- Displacement preview UI: single "JOIN" + "CANCEL" buttons (was "MOVE EVERYONE" / "JUST MOVE ME" / "CANCEL")
- Non-leaders cannot tap other pilot cards (no action sheet)
- Service worker cache bumped to `skwad-v5`
- `buildPilotInputs()` helper DRYs up `db.Pilot` → `freq.PilotInput` conversion

### Removed
- `reoptimizeForPilot()` — replaced by `FindMinimalDisplacement` Level 0
- `?rebalance` query parameter on join and channel-change endpoints
- `has_danger` field from preview API responses
